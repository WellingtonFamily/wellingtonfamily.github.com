After Iceland, we went to Germany to visit our Cousins.  At Anna and Carsten's we got to ride Salvo.  We also got to play on a trampline.

We went to KÃ¶ln and visited Kolner Dom, and rode in the Seilbahn to the other side of the Rhine to play in the park.

We also spent a dat at Altenburger Dom, and we went to a waffle house and ate waffles.

At Maria and Knauffie's we played with David and Elias.  We found a pool that had a fast river and super big water slides.

We went climbing on a high ropes course.  They let kids do things like this in Germany - here you have to be older.

We went to the Bergpark Willemshoe and saw the super tall Hurkules monument.  We had a  cool view from the top of the oktogon.  Also we climbed up the inside of the pyramid with Maria.  Then we went down lots and lots of steps to see the cascades (when the water pours out from the top and down all the steps.  After that the water goes down a super big hill that we rolled down, and at the bottom it makes a super high fountain.
