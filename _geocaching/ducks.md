title: "Ducks"

In 2002, The [Make Way for Ducklings](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=1ac81bdb-dc49-409b-ab1c-4b25a1cf04c0) cache served as a launching point for 16 travel ducks whose mission it was to travel the world.  I would love it if each of these ducks were able to make it to the Seattle area... though I know that some of them are likely lost forever.
